Welcome to the caDSR Sentinal Project!
=====================================

The caDSR Sentinel Tool allows users who have a caDSR account to create and manage Alert Definitions for content in the caDSR. Alert Definitions are a set of rules that are periodically evaluated against the caDSR.

The caDSR Sentinal is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
