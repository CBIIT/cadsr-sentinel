<p>This is the Daily clean up scripts.
</p>
<p>Some data in the caDSR is so complicated that simple database constraints and foreign keys are not sufficient to guard against
unwanted or inconsistent data. Daily scripts must be run to correct any unexpected metadata. For example while using the ISO 8859-15
character set, the control characters (anything with a decimal value &lt; 32) must be scrubbed to prevent undesirable downstream
effects.</p>
