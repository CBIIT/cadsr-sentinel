<body>
<p>This is the primary package for the Sentinel Tool User Interface.
</p>
<p>The user interface is built on the Struts MVC framework. The action classes
match the name of the JSP and JS files, e.g. Edit.java is the action class. The
form classes use the action class names suffixed with "Form", e.g. EditForm.java.
Tag libraries have also been written for JSP processing and when present are
suffixed with "Tag", e.g. EditTag.java. The first JSP displayed to the user is
Logon.jsp with the matching logic in Logon.java and LogonForm.java.
