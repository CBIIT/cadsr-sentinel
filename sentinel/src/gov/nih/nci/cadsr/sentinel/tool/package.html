<body>
<p>This is the primary package for the Sentinel Tool User Interface and Report
Generation. The package contains a number of classes which encapsulate the user
interface, processing logic and database access.
</p>
<p>The user interface is built on the Struts MVC framework. The action classes
match the name of the JSP and JS files, e.g. Edit.java is the action class. The
form classes use the action class names suffixed with "Form", e.g. EditForm.java.
Tag libraries have also been written for JSP processing and when present are
suffixed with "Tag", e.g. EditTag.java. The first JSP displayed to the user is
Logon.jsp with the matching logic in Logon.java and LogonForm.java.
</p>
<p>The processing logic is contained in a number of utility classes named by the
object of interest, e.g. ACData.java. These are used by various pieces of logic
throughout the package.
</p>
<p>The database access is encapsulated in DBAlert.java. All data access is through
utility methods in this class.
