<body>
<p>This is the package isolating all database access for the Sentinel Tool.
</p>
<p>The encapsulation of the database access to a separate package improves
the code maintenance. The encapsulation of the database access into specialized
classes facilitates a more portable and expandable design as new features are
added.
