                        The caDSR Sentinel Tool is a web-based tool that allows users to create and manage Alert Definitions for the caDSR database. Alert
                        Definitions are a set of rules that are periodically evaluated against the caDSR. If the conditions in those rules are met, notification
                        is sent to the user (via e-mail) in the form of a hyperlink to an Alert Report. Alert Reports detail the changes (activities) that have
                        taken place within the database.

                        The main page within the Sentinel Tool is the Alerts List page. All features of the tool are accessible from this page. When a task
                        completes, the tool often returns to this page. Initially, this page opens displaying either an empty list with a Welcome message
                        or the Alerts that you have created. From this page, you can also create a new Alert, view all Alerts in the database, and Edit an
                        existing Alert.

                        The buttons on the Alerts List page perform actions on one or more Alert Definitions in the list. These
                        buttons are enabled and disabled appropriately as items are selected.

                        <dd>
                            To enable, select exactly one Alert. The Edit page opens using the information from the selected Alert with some properties
                            modified to reflect the new state. See <a href="#using">Create Using</a> for a complete description.

                        <dt>Delete
                        <dd>
                            To enable, select one or more Alerts. A confirmation message box opens to avoid accidental deletion. Once
                            confirmed, the selected Alerts are permanently deleted from the database.
                            <br/><br/><u>Note:</u> This button is restricted to the Alert creator.
                            <br/><br/><u>Note:</u> To exclude an Alert in the Auto Run Process, it is not necessary to delete it. See

                        <dd>
                            To enable, select exactly one Alert. The Run Submission page opens allowing the selection of run options prior to submission
                            to the server. See <a href="#run">Run</a> for a complete description of the page.

                        <dt>Show All / Show Private

                            This button switches between "Show All" and "Show Private". Pressing "Show All" displays all alerts defined in the database and
                            changes the button label to "Show Private". Pressing "Show Private" displays alerts that were created by the current user and
                            changes the button label to "Show All".

                        For example, to sort the list by Name and Last Auto Run, first select the column heading for the Last Auto Run and then select

                            The frequency is selected by the Creator on the Edit Properties page. It defines when the Alert Definition is processed by the

                            The date/time is set by the Sentinel Automated Alert Report Generator when the Alert Definition is processed. This date is set whether or not a
                            report is generated. For example, the frequency of an Alert Definition is set to daily but the date/time shows a date from more than
                            a week ago. Upon inspection of the Alert Definition, note the Start and End dates are set and the Active period ended on the date of
                            the Last Auto Run. A blank date/time and the string "(not yet run)" indicates a report has never been created for this Alert by the

                            records are a level 2, and so on. For example, a Value Domain is changed, it is level 0. The Data Elements referencing the Value
                            Domain are a level 1. The Modules, Class Scheme Items, etc that reference the Data Elements are a level 2. And so it continues

                        The Manual Alert Run page provides input for a report date range and a selection to use either the creator as the sole recipient or the defined
                        recipient list. The request can then be submitted to the server for the single Alert Definition by selecting the Run button from the
                        List and Edit pages.

                        The process, called a Manual Run, executes on the web server which hosts the Sentinel Tool. A confirmation message appears after
                        submitting the request. Manual Runs always send an e-mail, the "Send a report from &hellip;" specified on the <a href="#repdetail">Edit page, Report Details tab</a>
                        is ignored. Although the confirmation message appears immediately, the time to create and send the Alert Report depends on many
                        factors including the number of manual runs being processed and the volume of output generated.

                        A Manual Run executes the same logic and code as an Auto Run with minor exceptions. First, the Manual Run only processes one Alert
                        Definition where the Auto Run may process many. Second, a report is always sent by a Manual Run.
                        When started from the Edit page, an Alert can be run without saving changes to the Definition.

                        <u>Note:</u> After submitting a Manual Run there is no means to monitor its progress or determine when the Report e-mail will be received.

                        change to the record being described. When the prefix begins with "Associated to &hellip;" the block indicates the record is associated in
                        some way to the most previous change block. These Associated records have not changed. They are provided for the user analysis of
                        possible collateral impacts occurring from the actual change. The Group Number shows the proximity of the change. For example:

                        graphical network diagram. Although the change blocks should only appear once, the associated record blocks most often have duplication.

                        Reports are prevented from becoming too large for the browser via a system configuration threshold. When a report exceeds the threshold
                        it is divided into multiple parts. The rows are counted as described above and not as individual lines. This is called a multi-part
                        report. The e-mail sent to each recipient will note the number of parts created. The link provided in the e-mail is to an index of links
                        to each part. Each file in a multi-part report shows the part number with Next and Previous links to facilitate reading and navigating
                        the files. If the report size becomes cumbersome specify a smaller value for the Maximum Associated To Level or make the Alert
